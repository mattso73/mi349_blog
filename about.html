        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am Brianna Mattson, I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Information Science with a Data Science Minor. I currently live in Eugene, Oregon (Go Ducks!) with my parents when I am not at school but am originally from Richmond, Virginia. I have two brothers, one older and one younger. Both my brothers are James Madison Dukes and the older now lives in Manhattan to live out his "finance bros" dream. My younger brother is a sophomore at James Madison University studying Biology wiht a Data Science focus. I have a 8 month old puppy, Teddy, who lives with me at school. She is a Jack Russell Terrier and my child. I actually put away 25% of every paycheck for Teddy as dogs are very expensive!</p>
